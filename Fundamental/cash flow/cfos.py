# Cash from Operations to Sales Ratio Calculator
# ----------------------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Cash from Operations to Sales Ratio measures the proportion of a company's sales that 
# are converted to cash from its operating activities. It indicates how effectively a company 
# is turning its sales into actual cash.
#
# Formula:
# Cash from Operations to Sales Ratio = Cash from Operations / Sales
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher ratio is generally favorable as it indicates that a larger proportion of sales 
# is being converted into cash. This could suggest efficient collections, optimal inventory 
# management, or effective control over other working capital elements.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

# Convert amounts where 1 million dollars is represented as 1.00, 10 million as 10.00, etc.
def convert_to_actual_value(value_in_millions):

# Hard-coded values for the company

# Cash from Operations (in million dollars format for simplicity)
cash_from_operations_in_millions = 1583.00 
cash_from_operations = convert_to_actual_value(cash_from_operations_in_millions)

# Sales (in million dollars format for simplicity)
sales_in_millions = 23606.00

# Hard-coded values for industry average

# Industry Average Cash from Operations (in million dollars format for simplicity)
industry_avg_cash_from_operations_in_millions = 1500.00  # Example value
industry_avg_cash_from_operations = convert_to_actual_value(industry_avg_cash_from_operations_in_millions)

# Industry Average Sales (in million dollars format for simplicity)
industry_avg_sales_in_millions = 23000.00  # Example value
industry_avg_sales = convert_to_actual_value(industry_avg_sales_in_millions)

# Calculate Cash from Operations to Sales Ratio for the company and the industry
cash_from_operations_to_sales_ratio = cash_from_operations / sales
industry_avg_cash_from_operations_to_sales_ratio = industry_avg_cash_from_operations / industry_avg_sales
