# Cash Flow Coverage Ratio Calculator
# -----------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Cash Flow Coverage Ratio determines the number of times cash flow from operations 
# can cover current liabilities. This ratio is significant in evaluating the liquidity 
# and solvency of an entity. A higher ratio is generally preferred as it indicates that 
# the company generates enough cash to cover its short-term obligations.
#
# Formula:
# Cash Flow Coverage Ratio = Cash Flow from Operations / Current Liabilities
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher Cash Flow Coverage Ratio indicates better liquidity and ability to cover 
# short-term obligations. A ratio of 1 or above is preferred, suggesting that cash flow 
# from operations is sufficient to cover current liabilities. Below 1 might be a cause 
# for concern.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

# Convert amounts where 1 million dollars is represented as 1.00, 10 million as 10.00, etc.

cash_flow_from_operations_in_millions = 1583.00

# Current Liabilities (in million dollars format for simplicity)
current_liabilities_in_millions = 4184.00

# Hard-coded values for industry average

# Industry Average Cash Flow from Operations (in million dollars format for simplicity)
industry_avg_cash_flow_from_operations_in_millions = 1520.00  # Example value
industry_avg_cash_flow_from_operations = convert_to_actual_value(industry_avg_cash_flow_from_operations_in_millions)

# Industry Average Current Liabilities (in million dollars format for simplicity)
industry_avg_current_liabilities_in_millions = 4000.00  # Example value
industry_avg_current_liabilities = convert_to_actual_value(industry_avg_current_liabilities_in_millions)

# Calculate Cash Flow Coverage Ratio for the company and the industry
cash_flow_coverage_ratio = cash_flow_from_operations / current_liabilities
industry_avg_cash_flow_coverage_ratio = industry_avg_cash_flow_from_operations / industry_avg_current_liabilities
