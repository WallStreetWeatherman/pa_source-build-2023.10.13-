# Basic EPS Calculation
# ---------------------
# Overview:
# Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) is a measure of the profit attributed to each outstanding 
# share of a company's common stock. It provides an indication of a company's profitability.
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher Basic EPS typically indicates greater profitability. It's essential to compare 
# Basic EPS across similar companies or the broader market to understand the relative performance.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values. For real-world application, data should be adjusted accordingly.

def convert_to_actual_value(value):
    """Converts the value in the format of 1.00 to actual $1 million."""
    return value * 1000000

# Hard-coded values for net income and number of outstanding shares
net_income = convert_to_actual_value(10.00)  # Example: $10 million in net income
number_of_shares = convert_to_actual_value(5.00)  # Example: 5 million outstanding shares

# Calculate Basic EPS
basic_eps = net_income / number_of_shares

# Output the result
desired_basic_eps_value = 2.50  # An example desired value for Basic EPS
