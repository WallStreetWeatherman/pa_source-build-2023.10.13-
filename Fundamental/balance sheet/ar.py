# Accounts Receivable Analysis
# ------------------------------
# Overview:
# Accounts Receivable (AR) denotes money owed to the company for delivered goods/services which haven't been paid.
#
# Desired Value:
# While higher AR indicates growing sales, if it's excessively high relative to the industry, it might suggest 
# problems with cash flow or the company's collection process. Context is crucial.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values. For real-world application, data should be adjusted accordingly.

def convert_to_actual_value(value):
    """Converts the value in the format of 1.00 to actual $1 million."""
    return value * 1000000

# Hard-coded value for Accounts Receivable
accounts_receivable = convert_to_actual_value(223.00)  # Example: $5 million in AR

# Analyze Accounts Receivable value
