# Cash to Current Assets Ratio Calculator
# ---------------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Cash to Current Assets Ratio reflects the percentage of a company's current assets
# that is comprised of cash or cash equivalents. It provides insights into the liquidity
# position of the company and indicates how much of the company's short-term assets 
# can be easily converted into cash.
#
# Formula:
# Cash to Current Assets Ratio = Cash & Cash Equivalents / Total Current Assets
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher ratio suggests that the company has a higher proportion of its current assets 
# in liquid form, which can be seen as a sign of financial strength, especially in times of 
# uncertainty. However, too high a ratio might also indicate that the company is not 
# reinvesting its cash effectively.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

# Total Current Assets (in million dollars format for simplicity)
total_current_assets_in_millions = 16304.00  
total_current_assets = convert_to_actual_value(total_current_assets_in_millions)

# Industry average for Cash to Current Assets Ratio (for comparison)

# Calculate Cash to Current Assets Ratio
