# Book Value Margin Analysis
# --------------------------
# Overview:
# Book Value Margin is the ratio of the book value of a company to its revenue.
# It provides insights into how much of the company's revenue is actually attributable to shareholders in terms of book value.
#
# Desired Value:
# A higher Book Value Margin is generally favorable as it indicates a strong balance sheet relative to revenue.
# A lower Book Value Margin may suggest a weaker financial position relative to the company's revenue.

# Hardcoded values (in $ millions, represented as 1.00 for 1 million)
revenue = 23606.00  # $100 million
book_value = 4210.00  # $75 million

# Average industry Book Value Margin (for comparison)
average_industry_book_value_margin = 0.65  # Example value

# Calculate Book Value Margin
book_value_margin = book_value / revenue
