# Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) Calculator
# --------------------------------------
# Overview:
# The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) represents the number of days it takes for a company 
# to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales.
# It's the sum of the Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO),
# and the Days Payable Outstanding (DPO).
#
# Formula:
# CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO
#
# Desired Value:
# A shorter CCC is generally more favorable as it indicates that a company can more 
# quickly convert its investments into cash. However, it's important to compare CCC 
# across similar companies in the same industry to get a relative perspective.
#
# Note: This script uses hard-coded values for demonstration. For real-world applications, 
# actual financial data values should be input.

# Hard-coded values

# Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) - Average number of days it takes to collect payment after a sale
DSO = 3.41  # Example value representing 30 days

# Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) - Average number of days to sell inventory
DIO = 107.34  # Example value representing 45 days

# Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) - Average number of days it takes to pay suppliers
DPO = 99.13  # Example value representing 25 days

# Calculate CCC
CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO

# Output the results
print(f"Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): {DSO} days")
print(f"Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO): {DIO} days")
print(f"Days Payable Outstanding (DPO): {DPO} days")
print(f"Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC): {CCC} days")

if CCC < 0:
    print("The company has a negative CCC, which indicates strong working capital management.")
elif CCC > 0 and CCC <= 30:
    print("The company has a short CCC, indicating efficient management of cash flows.")
else:
    print("The company has a longer CCC, which may indicate inefficiencies in cash flow management. This needs to be compared with industry benchmarks for a better perspective.")
